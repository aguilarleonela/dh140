Turn thy back and run?\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nFear me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nGREGORY.\\r\\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGREGORY.\\r\\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\\r\\nthem if they bear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nABRAM.\\r\\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nABRAM.\\r\\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?\\r\\n\\r\\nGREGORY.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nGREGORY.\\r\\nDo you quarrel, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nABRAM.\\r\\nQuarrel, sir?

I hate the word\\r\\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\\r\\nHave at thee, coward.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST CITIZEN.\\r\\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\\r\\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY CAPULET.\\r\\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\\r\\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\r\\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\r\\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\\r\\nWill they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\\r\\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\r\\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\\r\\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\r\\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\\r\\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\r\\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\\r\\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\r\\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\\r\\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\\r\\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\\r\\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\r\\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\\r\\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\\r\\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\r\\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\\r\\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\\r\\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\\r\\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\\r\\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\\r\\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\\r\\n Citizens and Servants._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\r\\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere were the servants of your adversary\\r\\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\r\\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\\r\\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\\r\\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\\r\\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\\r\\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\\r\\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\\r\\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\\r\\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\r\\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\\r\\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\\r\\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\\r\\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\\r\\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\\r\\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\\r\\nSo early walking did I see your son.\\r\\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\\r\\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\\r\\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\\r\\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\\r\\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\\r\\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\\r\\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\\r\\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\\r\\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\r\\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\r\\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\\r\\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\\r\\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\\r\\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\\r\\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\\r\\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\\r\\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\\r\\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\\r\\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\\r\\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\\r\\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\\r\\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\\r\\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\\r\\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\\r\\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\r\\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\r\\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\\r\\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\r\\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nGood morrow, cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nIs the day so young?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBut new struck nine.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\\r\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nIn love?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nOut.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nOf love?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\\r\\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\r\\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\\r\\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\r\\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\r\\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\\r\\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\r\\nO anything, of nothing first create!\\r\\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\r\\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\r\\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\r\\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\\r\\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\r\\nDost thou not laugh?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nNo coz, I rather weep.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGood heart, at what?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\\r\\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\r\\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\\r\\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\r\\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\r\\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\\r\\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\\r\\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\\r\\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\\r\\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\r\\nFarewell, my coz.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Going._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nSoft! I will go along:\\r\\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\\r\\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\\r\\nA word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.\\r\\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nI aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\\r\\nWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;\\r\\nAnd in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\\r\\nFrom love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.\\r\\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms\\r\\nNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,\\r\\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\\r\\nO she’s rich in beauty, only poor\\r\\nThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\r\\nFor beauty starv’d with her severity,\\r\\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\\r\\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\\r\\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\\r\\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\r\\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO teach me how I should forget to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\\r\\nExamine other beauties.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\n’Tis the way\\r\\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\\r\\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\\r\\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\\r\\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\\r\\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\r\\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,\\r\\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\\r\\nWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\\r\\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

O their bones, their bones!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring.

For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\r\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nStop there, stop there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\r\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nHere’s goodly gear!\\r\\nA sail, a sail!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nPeter!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nAnon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nMy fan, Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs it good-den?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\r\\nprick of noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\r\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\r\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\r\\nfault of a worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nYou say well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat hast thou found?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\r\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\r\\n[_Sings._]\\r\\n    An old hare hoar,\\r\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\r\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\r\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\r\\n    Is too much for a score\\r\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\r\\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI will follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\r\\nropery?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\r\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\r\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\r\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\r\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\r\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\r\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\r\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\r\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\r\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\r\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\r\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\r\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\r\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\r\\nvery weak dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\r\\nthee,—\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\r\\nbe a joyful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\r\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nBid her devise\\r\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\r\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\r\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\r\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\r\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\r\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\r\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\r\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\r\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\r\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\r\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\r\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\r\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\r\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\r\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\r\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\r\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\r\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Romeo._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nAnon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nBefore and apace.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE V.

That’s not so.\\r\\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\\r\\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\\r\\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\\r\\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\\r\\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\\r\\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\\r\\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\\r\\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\\r\\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\\r\\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\\r\\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\\r\\nAnd his to me.\\r\\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\\r\\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nO God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\\r\\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nPeter, stay at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Peter._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\\r\\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\\r\\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\\r\\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\\r\\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\\r\\nNay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\\r\\nout of breath?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\\r\\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\\r\\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\r\\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\r\\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\\r\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\r\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\r\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\r\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\r\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\r\\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\r\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\\r\\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\r\\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\r\\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\\r\\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\\r\\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\r\\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\\r\\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\\r\\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\\r\\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest.\\r\\n‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\\r\\n‘Where is your mother?’\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nO God’s lady dear,\\r\\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\\r\\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\\r\\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nI have.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;\\r\\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\\r\\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\\r\\nThey’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\\r\\nHie you to church. I must another way,\\r\\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\\r\\nMust climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\\r\\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\\r\\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\\r\\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\\r\\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\\r\\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\\r\\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\\r\\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\\r\\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\\r\\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\\r\\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\\r\\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\\r\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\r\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\r\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\r\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\r\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\r\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\r\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\r\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\r\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\r\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\r\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\r\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\r\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\r\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\r\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\r\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\r\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\r\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\r\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I. A public Place.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\\r\\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\\r\\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\r\\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\\r\\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\\r\\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\\r\\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAm I like such a fellow?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\\r\\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAnd what to?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\\r\\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\r\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\r\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\r\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\r\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\r\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\r\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\r\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\r\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\r\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\r\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\r\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe fee simple! O simple!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Tybalt and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBy my heel, I care not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\\r\\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\\r\\nword and a blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\r\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\\r\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\r\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\r\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\r\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\r\\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\r\\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\\r\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\r\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\r\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\r\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\r\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\r\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\\r\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\r\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\r\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\r\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\r\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\r\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\r\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\r\\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\\r\\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCome, sir, your passado.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\r\\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\\r\\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\r\\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\r\\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nI am hurt.\\r\\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\\r\\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nWhat, art thou hurt?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.\\r\\nWhere is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Page._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\\r\\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\r\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\r\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\r\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\r\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI thought all for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\r\\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\\r\\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\\r\\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\\r\\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\\r\\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\\r\\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\\r\\nHath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\\r\\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\\r\\nAnd in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter Benvolio.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\\r\\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,\\r\\nWhich too untimely here did scorn the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\\r\\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\\r\\n\\r\\n Re-enter Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\\r\\nAway to heaven respective lenity,\\r\\nAnd fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\\r\\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again\\r\\nThat late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\\r\\nIs but a little way above our heads,\\r\\nStaying for thine to keep him company.\\r\\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\\r\\nShalt with him hence.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThis shall determine that.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nRomeo, away, be gone!\\r\\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\\r\\nStand not amaz’d.

O my brother’s child!\\r\\nO Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d\\r\\nOf my dear kinsman!

All this uttered\\r\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\r\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\r\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\r\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\r\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\r\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\r\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\r\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\r\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\r\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\r\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\r\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\r\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\r\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\r\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\r\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\r\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\r\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\r\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\r\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY CAPULET.\\r\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\r\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\r\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\r\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\r\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\r\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\r\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\r\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\r\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nAnd for that offence\\r\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\r\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\r\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\r\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\r\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\r\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\r\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\r\\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\\r\\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\\r\\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\\r\\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

Heaven is here\\r\\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\\r\\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\r\\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\\r\\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\\r\\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\\r\\nIn carrion flies than Romeo.

Banished?\\r\\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\\r\\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,\\r\\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\r\\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\\r\\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\\r\\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\\r\\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nYet banished?

The time is very short.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\\r\\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\\r\\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\\r\\nAnd therefore have I little talk’d of love;\\r\\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\\r\\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\\r\\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway;\\r\\nAnd in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,\\r\\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\\r\\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\\r\\nMay be put from her by society.\\r\\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\n[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—\\r\\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nWhat must be shall be.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nThat’s a certain text.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nCome you to make confession to this father?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nI will confess to you that I love him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,\\r\\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nThe tears have got small victory by that;\\r\\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\\r\\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.\\r\\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\\r\\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—\\r\\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—\\r\\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,\\r\\nTill then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\\r\\nCome weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;\\r\\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\\r\\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\\r\\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\\r\\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\\r\\nIf in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\\r\\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\\r\\nAnd with this knife I’ll help it presently.\\r\\nGod join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;\\r\\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\\r\\nShall be the label to another deed,\\r\\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\\r\\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\\r\\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\\r\\nGive me some present counsel, or behold\\r\\n’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\\r\\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\\r\\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\\r\\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\\r\\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die,\\r\\nIf what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\\r\\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\\r\\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\\r\\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\\r\\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\\r\\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\\r\\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\\r\\nThat cop’st with death himself to scape from it.\\r\\nAnd if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\\r\\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\\r\\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\\r\\nWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;\\r\\nOr hide me nightly in a charnel-house,\\r\\nO’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,\\r\\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\\r\\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave,\\r\\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\\r\\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,\\r\\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\\r\\nTo live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent\\r\\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\\r\\nTomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\\r\\nLet not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\\r\\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\\r\\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off,\\r\\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\\r\\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\\r\\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease.\\r\\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,\\r\\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\\r\\nTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,\\r\\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life.\\r\\nEach part depriv’d of supple government,\\r\\nShall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\\r\\nAnd in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death\\r\\nThou shalt continue two and forty hours,\\r\\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\\r\\nNow when the bridegroom in the morning comes\\r\\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\\r\\nThen as the manner of our country is,\\r\\nIn thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,\\r\\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\\r\\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\\r\\nIn the meantime, against thou shalt awake,\\r\\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\\r\\nAnd hither shall he come, and he and I\\r\\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\\r\\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\\r\\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\\r\\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\\r\\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\\r\\nIn this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed\\r\\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nLove give me strength, and strength shall help afford.\\r\\nFarewell, dear father.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\r\\nThis dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\\r\\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\\r\\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY CAPULET.\\r\\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\\r\\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Montague and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\\r\\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\\r\\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.\\r\\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nLook, and thou shalt see.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\\r\\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\r\\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\\r\\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent,\\r\\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\\r\\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\r\\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\\r\\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\\r\\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\\r\\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\\r\\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\r\\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\\r\\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\\r\\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\\r\\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\\r\\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\\r\\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\\r\\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\r\\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\\r\\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\r\\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\\r\\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\\r\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\r\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\r\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\r\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\r\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\r\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\r\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\r\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\r\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\r\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\r\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\r\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\r\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\r\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\r\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\r\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\r\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\r\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\r\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\r\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\r\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\r\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\r\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\r\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\r\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\r\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\r\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\r\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\r\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\r\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\r\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\r\\n\\r\\nBALTHASAR.\\r\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\r\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\r\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\r\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\r\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\r\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\r\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\r\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAGE.\\r\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\r\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\r\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\r\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\r\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\r\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\r\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\r\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\r\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\r\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\r\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\r\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\r\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\r\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\r\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\r\\nCan I demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nBut I can give thee more,\\r\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\r\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\r\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\r\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\r\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\r\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\r\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\r\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\r\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\r\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

Turn thy back and run?\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nFear me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nGREGORY.\\r\\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGREGORY.\\r\\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMPSON.\\r\\nNay, as they dare.

I hate the word\\r\\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\\r\\nHave at thee, coward.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST CITIZEN.\\r\\nClubs, bills and partisans!

Hold me not, let me go.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\r\\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\r\\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\\r\\nWill they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\\r\\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\r\\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\\r\\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\r\\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\\r\\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\r\\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\\r\\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\r\\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\\r\\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\\r\\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\\r\\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\r\\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\\r\\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\\r\\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\r\\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\\r\\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\\r\\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\\r\\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\\r\\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\\r\\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\\r\\n Citizens and Servants._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\r\\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere were the servants of your adversary\\r\\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\r\\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\\r\\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\\r\\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\\r\\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\\r\\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\\r\\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\\r\\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\\r\\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\r\\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\\r\\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\\r\\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\\r\\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\\r\\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\\r\\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\\r\\nSo early walking did I see your son.\\r\\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\\r\\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\\r\\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\\r\\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\\r\\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\\r\\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\\r\\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\\r\\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\\r\\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\r\\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\r\\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\\r\\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\\r\\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\\r\\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\\r\\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\\r\\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\\r\\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\\r\\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\\r\\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\\r\\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\\r\\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\\r\\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\\r\\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\\r\\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\\r\\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\r\\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\r\\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\\r\\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\r\\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nGood morrow, cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nIs the day so young?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBut new struck nine.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\\r\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nIt was.

O me! What fray was here?\\r\\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\r\\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\\r\\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\r\\nO anything, of nothing first create!\\r\\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\r\\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\r\\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\r\\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\\r\\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\r\\nDost thou not laugh?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nNo coz, I rather weep.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGood heart, at what?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\\r\\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\r\\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\\r\\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\r\\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\r\\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\\r\\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\\r\\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\\r\\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\\r\\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\r\\nFarewell, my coz.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Going._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nSoft! I will go along:\\r\\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\\r\\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nGroan!

O their bones, their bones!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring.

We’ll to dinner thither.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI will follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\r\\nropery?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\r\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\r\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\r\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\r\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\r\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\r\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\r\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\r\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\r\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\r\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\r\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\r\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\r\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\r\\nvery weak dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\r\\nthee,—\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\r\\nbe a joyful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\r\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nBid her devise\\r\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\r\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\r\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\r\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\r\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\r\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\r\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\r\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\r\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\r\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\r\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\r\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\r\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\r\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\r\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\r\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\r\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\r\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAy, a thousand times.

Send thy man away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nPeter, stay at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Peter._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\\r\\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\\r\\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\\r\\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\\r\\nFie, how my bones ache!

Answer to that;\\r\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\r\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\r\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\r\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\r\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\r\\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\r\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\\r\\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nLord, how my head aches!

The sweetest honey\\r\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\r\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\r\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\r\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\r\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\r\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\r\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\r\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\r\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\r\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\r\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\r\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\r\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\r\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\r\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\r\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\r\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\r\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\r\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.

Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\r\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\r\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\r\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\r\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\r\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\r\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\r\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\r\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\r\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\r\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\r\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe fee simple! O simple!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Tybalt and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBy my heel, I care not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\\r\\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nAnd but one word with one of us?

What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\r\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\\r\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\r\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\r\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\r\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\r\\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\r\\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\\r\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\r\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\r\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\r\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\r\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\r\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\\r\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\r\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\r\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\r\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\r\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\r\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\r\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\r\\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\\r\\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCome, sir, your passado.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\r\\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\\r\\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\r\\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\r\\nHold, Tybalt!

Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Page._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\\r\\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\r\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\r\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\r\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\r\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI thought all for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\r\\nOr I shall faint.

Your houses!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\\r\\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\\r\\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\\r\\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\\r\\nHath been my cousin.

All this uttered\\r\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\r\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\r\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\r\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\r\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\r\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\r\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\r\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\r\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\r\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\r\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\r\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\r\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\r\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\r\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\r\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\r\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\r\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\r\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\r\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY CAPULET.\\r\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\r\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\r\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\r\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\r\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\r\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\r\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\r\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\r\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nAnd for that offence\\r\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\r\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\r\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\r\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\r\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\r\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\r\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\r\\nTherefore use none.

Heaven is here\\r\\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\\r\\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\r\\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\\r\\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\\r\\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\\r\\nIn carrion flies than Romeo.

Banished?\\r\\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\\r\\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,\\r\\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\r\\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\\r\\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\\r\\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\\r\\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nYet banished?

Then all alone\\r\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\r\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\r\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\r\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\r\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\r\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\r\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\r\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\r\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\r\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\r\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\r\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\r\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\r\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\r\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\r\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\r\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\r\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\r\\n\\r\\nBALTHASAR.\\r\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\r\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\r\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\r\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\r\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\r\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\r\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\r\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAGE.\\r\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\r\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\r\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\r\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\r\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\r\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\r\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\r\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\r\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\r\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\r\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\r\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\r\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\r\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\r\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\r\\nCan I demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nBut I can give thee more,\\r\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\r\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\r\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\r\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\r\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\r\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\r\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\r\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\r\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\r\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
