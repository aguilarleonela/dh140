Two households, both alike in dignity, \\n In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, \\n From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, \\n Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. \\n From forth the fatal loins of these two foes \\n A pair of star-cross\\'d lovers take their life;  Whose misadventur\\'d piteous overthrows \\n Doth with their death bury their parents\\' strife.  The fearful passage of their death-mark\\'d love,  And the continuance of their parents\\' rage, \\n Which, but their children\\'s end, naught could remove,  Is now the two hours\\' traffic of our stage; \\n The which if you with patient ears attend, \\n What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.  [Exit.] \\nACT I. Scene I. \\nVerona. A public place. \\nEnter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet. \\n Samp. Gregory, on my word, we\\'ll not carry coals.  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers. \\n Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we\\'ll draw. \\n Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved. \\n Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. \\n Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.  Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn\\'st away. \\n Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take  the wall of any man or maid of Montague\\'s.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 3/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the  wall. \\n Samp. \\'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,  are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague\\'s men  from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. \\n Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. \\n Samp. \\'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have  fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off  their heads. \\n Greg. The heads of the maids? \\n Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.  Take it in what sense thou wilt. \\n Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it. \\n Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and \\'tis known I  am a pretty piece of flesh. \\n Greg. \\'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst  been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of  Montagues. \\n Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. \\n Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.  Greg. How? turn thy back and run? \\n Samp. Fear me not. \\n Greg. No, marry. I fear thee! \\n Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. \\n Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is  disgrace to them, if they bear it. \\n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. \\n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. \\n Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my  thumb, sir. \\n Greg. Do you quarrel, sir? \\n Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. \\n Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as  you.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 4/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Abr. No better. \\n Samp. Well, sir. \\n Enter Benvolio. \\n Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say \\'better.\\' Here comes one of my  master\\'s kinsmen. \\n Samp. Yes, better, sir. \\n Abr. You lie. \\n Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.  They fight. \\n Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.] \\n Put up your swords. You know not what you do.  Enter Tybalt. \\n Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?  Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. \\n Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,  Or manage it to part these men with me. \\n Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. \\n Have at thee, coward! They fight. \\n Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or  partisans. \\n Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!  Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. \\n Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? \\n Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come \\n And flourishes his blade in spite of me. \\n Enter Old Montague and his Wife. \\n Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.  Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. \\n Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, \\n Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel- \\n Will they not hear?

On pain of torture, from those bloody hands \\n Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground  And hear the sentence of your moved prince. \\n Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word \\n By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, \\n Have thrice disturb\\'d the quiet of our streets  And made Verona\\'s ancient citizens \\n Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments \\n To wield old partisans, in hands as old, \\n Cank\\'red with peace, to part your cank\\'red hate.  If ever you disturb our streets again, \\n Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.  For this time all the rest depart away. \\n You, Capulet, shall go along with me; \\n And, Montague, come you this afternoon, \\n To know our farther pleasure in this case, \\n To old Freetown, our common judgment place. \\n Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.  Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. \\n Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? \\n Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary \\n And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.  I drew to part them. In the instant came \\n The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar\\'d; \\n Which, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears, \\n He swung about his head and cut the winds, \\n Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn.  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,  Came more and more, and fought on part and part,  Till the Prince came, who parted either part. \\n M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?  Right glad I am he was not at this fray. \\n Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun \\n Peer\\'d forth the golden window of the East, \\n A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; \\n Where, underneath the grove of sycamore \\n That westward rooteth from the city\\'s side, \\n So early walking did I see your son. \\n Towards him I made; but he was ware of me \\n And stole into the covert of the wood. \\n I- measuring his affections by my own, \\n Which then most sought where most might not be found,  Being one too many by my weary self- \\n Pursu\\'d my humour, not Pursuing his, \\n And gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me. \\n Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen, \\n With tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew,  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun \\n Should in the furthest East bean to draw \\n The shady curtains from Aurora\\'s bed, \\n Away from light steals home my heavy son \\n And private in his chamber pens himself, \\n Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight \\n And makes himself an artificial night. \\n Black and portentous must this humour prove \\n Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 6/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? \\n Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him \\n Ben. Have you importun\\'d him by any means? \\n Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; \\n But he, his own affections\\' counsellor, \\n Is to himself- I will not say how true- \\n But to himself so secret and so close, \\n So far from sounding and discovery, \\n As is the bud bit with an envious worm \\n Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. \\n Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,  We would as willingly give cure as know. \\n Enter Romeo. \\n Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,  I\\'ll know his grievance, or be much denied. \\n Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay \\n To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let\\'s away,  Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. \\n Ben. Good morrow, cousin. \\n Rom. Is the day so young? \\n Ben. But new struck nine. \\n Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long. \\n Was that my father that went hence so fast? \\n Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours?  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.  Ben. In love? \\n Rom. Out- \\n Ben. Of love? \\n Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. \\n Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, \\n Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! \\n Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!  Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?

Good heart, at what? \\n Ben. At thy good heart\\'s oppression. \\n Rom. Why, such is love\\'s transgression. \\n Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest  With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.  Love is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs;  Being purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes;  Being vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears.  What is it else? A madness most discreet,  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. \\n Farewell, my coz. \\n Ben. Soft! I will go along. \\n An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. \\n Rom. Tut!

Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? \\n Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;  For beauty, starv\\'d with her severity, \\n Cuts beauty off from all posterity. \\n She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,  To merit bliss by making me despair. \\n She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow  Do I live dead that live to tell it now. \\n Ben.

But saying o\\'er what I have said before: \\n My child is yet a stranger in the world, \\n She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;  Let two more summers wither in their pride \\n Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. \\n Par.

What, Juliet! \\n Enter Juliet. \\n Jul. How now? Who calls? \\n Nurse. Your mother. \\n Jul. Madam, I am here. \\n What is your will? \\n Wife.

Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.  Wife. She\\'s not fourteen. \\n Nurse. I\\'ll lay fourteen of my teeth- \\n And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-  She is not fourteen. How long is it now \\n To Lammastide? \\n Wife. A fortnight and odd days. \\n Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, \\n Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.  Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)  Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; \\n She was too good for me. But, as I said, \\n On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;  That shall she, marry; I remember it well. \\n \\'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;  And she was wean\\'d (I never shall forget it),  Of all the days of the year, upon that day;  For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, \\n Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.  My lord and you were then at Mantua. \\n Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, \\n When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple  Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, \\n To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!  Shake, quoth the dovehouse! \\'Twas no need, I trow,  To bid me trudge. \\n And since that time it is eleven years, \\n For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th\\' rood,  She could have run and waddled all about; \\n For even the day before, she broke her brow;  And then my husband (God be with his soul! \\n \\'A was a merry man) took up the child. \\n \\'Yea,\\' quoth he, \\'dost thou fall upon thy face?  Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;  Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' and, by my holidam, \\n The pretty wretch left crying, and said \\'Ay.\\'  To see now how a jest shall come about! \\n I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,  I never should forget it. \\'Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' quoth he,  And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\' \\n Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. \\n Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh  To think it should leave crying and say \\'Ay.\\'  And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow \\n A bump as big as a young cock\\'rel\\'s stone; \\n A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly. \\n \\'Yea,\\' quoth my husband, \\'fall\\'st upon thy face?  Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;  Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' It stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\' \\n Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. \\n Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!  Thou wast the prettiest babe that e\\'er I nurs\\'d.  An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. \\n Wife.

It is an honour that I dream not of. \\n Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse, \\n I would say thou hadst suck\\'d wisdom from thy teat. \\n Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, \\n Are made already mothers. By my count, \\n I was your mother much upon these years \\n That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: \\n The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. \\n Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man \\n As all the world- why he\\'s a man of wax. \\n Wife. Verona\\'s summer hath not such a flower. \\n Nurse. Nay, he\\'s a flower, in faith- a very flower. \\n Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?  This night you shall behold him at our feast.  Read o\\'er the volume of young Paris\\' face, \\n And find delight writ there with beauty\\'s pen;  Examine every married lineament, \\n And see how one another lends content; \\n And what obscur\\'d in this fair volume lies \\n Find written in the margent of his eyes, \\n This precious book of love, this unbound lover,  To beautify him only lacks a cover. \\n The fish lives in the sea, and \\'tis much pride  For fair without the fair within to hide. \\n That book in many\\'s eyes doth share the glory,  That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;  So shall you share all that he doth possess, \\n By having him making yourself no less. \\n Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men \\n Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris\\' love? \\n Jul. I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move;  But no more deep will I endart mine eye \\n Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.  Enter Servingman. \\n Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv\\'d up, you call\\'d,  my young lady ask\\'d for, the nurse curs\\'d in the pantry, and  everything in extremity. I must hence to wait.

Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.  Being but heavy, I will bear the light. \\n Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. \\n Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes  With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead \\n So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. \\n Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid\\'s wings \\n And soar with them above a common bound. \\n Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft \\n To soar with his light feathers; and so bound  I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. \\n Under love\\'s heavy burthen do I sink. \\n Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-  Too great oppression for a tender thing. \\n Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, \\n Too rude, too boist\\'rous, and it pricks like thorn. \\n Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.  Give me a case to put my visage in. \\n A visor for a visor! What care I \\n What curious eye doth quote deformities? \\n Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. \\n Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in \\n But every man betake him to his legs. \\n Rom. A torch for me!

That dreamers often lie. \\n Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. \\n Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.  She is the fairies\\' midwife, and she comes  In shape no bigger than an agate stone \\n On the forefinger of an alderman, \\n Drawn with a team of little atomies \\n Athwart men\\'s noses as they lie asleep; \\n Her wagon spokes made of long spinners\\' legs,  The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;  Her traces, of the smallest spider\\'s web;  Her collars, of the moonshine\\'s wat\\'ry beams;  Her whip, of cricket\\'s bone; the lash, of film;  Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, \\n Not half so big as a round little worm \\n Prick\\'d from the lazy finger of a maid; \\n Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, \\n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,  Time out o\\' mind the fairies\\' coachmakers.  And in this state she \\'gallops night by night  Through lovers\\' brains, and then they dream of love;  O\\'er courtiers\\' knees, that dream on cursies straight;  O\\'er lawyers\\' fingers, who straight dream on fees;  O\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on kisses dream,  Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.  Sometime she gallops o\\'er a courtier\\'s nose,  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\\'s tail  Tickling a parson\\'s nose as \\'a lies asleep,  Then dreams he of another benefice. \\n Sometimes she driveth o\\'er a soldier\\'s neck,  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,  Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,  And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab \\n That plats the manes of horses in the night  And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,  Which once untangled much misfortune bodes  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,  That presses them and learns them first to bear,  Making them women of good carriage. \\n This is she- \\n Rom.

He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.  Call, good Mercutio. \\n Mer. Nay, I\\'ll conjure too. \\n Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! \\n Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; \\n Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied! \\n Cry but \\'Ay me!\\' pronounce but \\'love\\' and \\'dove\\';  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, \\n One nickname for her purblind son and heir, \\n Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim \\n When King Cophetua lov\\'d the beggar maid! \\n He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;  The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. \\n I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright eyes. \\n By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, \\n By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,  And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, \\n That in thy likeness thou appear to us! \\n Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. \\n Mer. This cannot anger him. \\'Twould anger him \\n To raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle \\n Of some strange nature, letting it there stand  Till she had laid it and conjur\\'d it down. \\n That were some spite; my invocation \\n Is fair and honest: in his mistress\\' name, \\n I conjure only but to raise up him. \\n Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees  To be consorted with the humorous night. \\n Blind is his love and best befits the dark. \\n Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.  Now will he sit under a medlar tree \\n And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit  As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.

Enter Juliet above at a window. \\n But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?  It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! \\n Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, \\n Who is already sick and pale with grief \\n That thou her maid art far more fair than she.  Be not her maid, since she is envious. \\n Her vestal livery is but sick and green, \\n And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. \\n It is my lady; O, it is my love! \\n O that she knew she were! \\n She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?  Her eye discourses; I will answer it. \\n I am too bold; \\'tis not to me she speaks. \\n Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, \\n Having some business, do entreat her eyes \\n To twinkle in their spheres till they return.  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven \\n Would through the airy region stream so bright  That birds would sing and think it were not night.  See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! \\n O that I were a glove upon that hand, \\n That I might touch that cheek! \\n Jul. Ay me! \\n Rom. She speaks. \\n O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art \\n As glorious to this night, being o\\'er my head,  As is a winged messenger of heaven \\n Unto the white-upturned wond\\'ring eyes \\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him \\n When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds \\n And sails upon the bosom of the air. \\n Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?  Deny thy father and refuse thy name! \\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, \\n And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet. \\n Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? \\n Jul. \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. \\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 21/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n What\\'s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part \\n Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!  What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose  By any other name would smell as sweet. \\n So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call\\'d,  Retain that dear perfection which he owes  Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;  And for that name, which is no part of thee, \\n Take all myself. \\n Rom. I take thee at thy word. \\n Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new baptiz\\'d;  Henceforth I never will be Romeo. \\n Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen\\'d in night,  So stumblest on my counsel? \\n Rom. By a name \\n I know not how to tell thee who I am. \\n My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,  Because it is an enemy to thee. \\n Had I it written, I would tear the word. \\n Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words  Of that tongue\\'s utterance, yet I know the sound.  Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? \\n Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. \\n Jul. How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,  And the place death, considering who thou art,  If any of my kinsmen find thee here. \\n Rom. With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'erperch these walls;  For stony limits cannot hold love out, \\n And what love can do, that dares love attempt.  Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. \\n Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee. \\n Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye  Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,  And I am proof against their enmity. \\n Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here. \\n Rom. I have night\\'s cloak to hide me from their sight;  And but thou love me, let them find me here.  My life were better ended by their hate \\n Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.  Jul. By whose direction found\\'st thou out this place? \\n Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.  He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. \\n I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far \\n As that vast shore wash\\'d with the farthest sea,  I would adventure for such merchandise. \\n Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek  For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.

Yet, if thou swear\\'st,  Thou mayst prove false. At lovers\\' perjuries,  They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, \\n If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. \\n Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, \\n I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,  So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, \\n And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;  But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true  Than those that have more cunning to be strange.  I should have been more strange, I must confess,  But that thou overheard\\'st, ere I was ware, \\n My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me, \\n And not impute this yielding to light love, \\n Which the dark night hath so discovered. \\n Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, \\n That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops- \\n Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th\\' inconstant moon,  That monthly changes in her circled orb, \\n Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. \\n Rom. What shall I swear by? \\n Jul. Do not swear at all; \\n Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,  Which is the god of my idolatry, \\n And I\\'ll believe thee. \\n Rom. If my heart\\'s dear love- \\n Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,  I have no joy of this contract to-night. \\n It is too rash, too unadvis\\'d, too sudden; \\n Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be  Ere one can say \\'It lightens.\\' Sweet, good night!  This bud of love, by summer\\'s ripening breath,  May prove a beauteous flow\\'r when next we meet.  Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest  Come to thy heart as that within my breast! \\n Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? \\n Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?  Rom. Th\\' exchange of thy love\\'s faithful vow for mine. \\n Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;  And yet I would it were to give again. \\n Rom. Would\\'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? \\n Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again. \\n And yet I wish but for the thing I have. \\n My bounty is as boundless as the sea, \\n My love as deep; the more I give to thee, \\n The more I have, for both are infinite. \\n I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu! \\n [Nurse] calls within.  Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. \\n Stay but a little, I will come again.

I am afeard, \\n Being in night, all this is but a dream, \\n Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. \\n Enter Juliet above. \\n Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.  If that thy bent of love be honourable, \\n Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,  By one that I\\'ll procure to come to thee, \\n Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;  And all my fortunes at thy foot I\\'ll lay \\n And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

By-and-by I come.- \\n To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief. \\n To-morrow will I send. \\n Rom. So thrive my soul- \\n Jul. A thousand times good night! Exit. \\n Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!  Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;  But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. \\n Enter Juliet again, [above]. \\n Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer\\'s voice  To lure this tassel-gentle back again! \\n Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud; \\n Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, \\n And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine  With repetition of my Romeo\\'s name. \\n Romeo! \\n Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name. \\n How silver-sweet sound lovers\\' tongues by night,  Like softest music to attending ears! \\n Jul. Romeo! \\n Rom. My dear? \\n Jul. At what o\\'clock to-morrow \\n Shall I send to thee? \\n Rom. By the hour of nine. \\n Jul. I will not fail. \\'Tis twenty years till then.  I have forgot why I did call thee back. \\n Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it. \\n Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 24/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Rememb\\'ring how I love thy company. \\n Rom. And I\\'ll still stay, to have thee still forget,  Forgetting any other home but this. \\n Jul. \\'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-  And yet no farther than a wanton\\'s bird, \\n That lets it hop a little from her hand, \\n Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, \\n And with a silk thread plucks it back again,  So loving-jealous of his liberty. \\n Rom. I would I were thy bird. \\n Jul. Sweet, so would I. \\n Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.  Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,  That I shall say good night till it be morrow.  [Exit.] \\n Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!  Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!  Hence will I to my ghostly father\\'s cell, \\n His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. \\n Exit \\nScene III. \\nFriar Laurence\\'s cell. \\nEnter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket. \\n Friar. The grey-ey\\'d morn smiles on the frowning night,  Check\\'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;  And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels \\n From forth day\\'s path and Titan\\'s fiery wheels.  Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye \\n The day to cheer and night\\'s dank dew to dry,  I must up-fill this osier cage of ours \\n With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.  The earth that\\'s nature\\'s mother is her tomb.  What is her burying gave, that is her womb; \\n And from her womb children of divers kind \\n We sucking on her natural bosom find; \\n Many for many virtues excellent, \\n None but for some, and yet all different. \\n O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies \\n In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;  For naught so vile that on the earth doth live  But to the earth some special good doth give;  Nor aught so good but, strain\\'d from that fair use,  Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.  Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, \\n And vice sometime\\'s by action dignified. \\n Within the infant rind of this small flower \\n Poison hath residence, and medicine power; \\n For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;  Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.  Two such opposed kings encamp them still \\n In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;  And where the worser is predominant, \\n Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 25/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Enter Romeo. \\n Rom. Good morrow, father. \\n Friar. Benedicite! \\n What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? \\n Young son, it argues a distempered head \\n So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. \\n Care keeps his watch in every old man\\'s eye,  And where care lodges sleep will never lie;  But where unbruised youth with unstuff\\'d brain  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.  Therefore thy earliness doth me assure \\n Thou art uprous\\'d with some distemp\\'rature;  Or if not so, then here I hit it right- \\n Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. \\n Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? \\n Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. \\n I have forgot that name, and that name\\'s woe.  Friar. That\\'s my good son! But where hast thou been then? \\n Rom. I\\'ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.  I have been feasting with mine enemy, \\n Where on a sudden one hath wounded me \\n That\\'s by me wounded. Both our remedies \\n Within thy help and holy physic lies. \\n I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, \\n My intercession likewise steads my foe. \\n Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. \\n Rom. Then plainly know my heart\\'s dear love is set  On the fair daughter of rich Capulet; \\n As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, \\n And all combin\\'d, save what thou must combine  By holy marriage. When, and where, and how  We met, we woo\\'d, and made exchange of vow,  I\\'ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,  That thou consent to marry us to-day. \\n Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!  Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,  So soon forsaken? Young men\\'s love then lies  Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.  Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine \\n Hath wash\\'d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!  How much salt water thrown away in waste,  To season love, that of it doth not taste!  The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,  Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.  Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit  Of an old tear that is not wash\\'d off yet.  If e\\'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,  Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.  And art thou chang\\'d?

Thou chid\\'st me oft for loving Rosaline. \\n Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. \\n Rom. And bad\\'st me bury love. \\n Friar. Not in a grave \\n To lay one in, another out to have. \\n Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now  Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.  The other did not so. \\n Friar. O, she knew well \\n Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.  But come, young waverer, come go with me. \\n In one respect I\\'ll thy assistant be; \\n For this alliance may so happy prove \\n To turn your households\\' rancour to pure love.  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste. \\n Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.  Exeunt. \\nScene IV. \\nA street. \\nEnter Benvolio and Mercutio. \\n Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be? \\n Came he not home to-night? \\n Ben. Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man. \\n Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,  Torments him so that he will sure run mad. \\n Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, \\n Hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house. \\n Mer. A challenge, on my life. \\n Ben. Romeo will answer it. \\n Mer.

Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb\\'d with a white  wench\\'s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the  very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy\\'s  butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt? \\n Ben.

Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch  flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she  had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,  Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,  but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There\\'s a French  salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit  fairly last night. \\n Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive? \\n Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a  case as mine a man may strain courtesy. \\n Mer. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a  man to bow in the hams. \\n Rom. Meaning, to cursy. \\n Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it. \\n Rom.

Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out  thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may  remain, after the wearing, solely singular. \\n Rom.

Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not  there for the goose. \\n Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. \\n Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not! \\n Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv\\'d in to a sweet goose? \\n Mer. O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch  narrow to an ell broad! \\n Rom. I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\' which, added to  the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. \\n Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now  art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by  art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a  great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in  a hole. \\n Ben. Stop there, stop there! \\n Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. \\n Mer. O, thou art deceiv\\'d!

A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and  will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month. \\n Nurse. An \\'a speak anything against me, I\\'ll take him down, an \\'a \\n were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,  I\\'ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his  flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must  stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure! \\n Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my  weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as  soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the  law on my side. \\n Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me  quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,  my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I  will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead  her into a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of  behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and  therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 30/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n an ill thing to be off\\'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. \\n Rom.

What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me. \\n Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I  take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. \\n Rom. Bid her devise \\n Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; \\n And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell \\n Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains. \\n Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny. \\n Rom. Go to! I say you shall. \\n Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there. \\n Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall. \\n Within this hour my man shall be with thee \\n And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, \\n Which to the high topgallant of my joy \\n Must be my convoy in the secret night. \\n Farewell. Be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains. \\n Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress. \\n Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. \\n Rom. What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse? \\n Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say, \\n Two may keep counsel, putting one away? \\n Rom. I warrant thee my man\\'s as true as steel. \\n Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!  when \\'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in  town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,  good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I  anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;  but I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any  clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both  with a letter? \\n Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R. \\n Nurse. Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name.

Love\\'s heralds should be thoughts,  Which ten times faster glide than the sun\\'s beams  Driving back shadows over low\\'ring hills. \\n Therefore do nimble-pinion\\'d doves draw Love, \\n And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. \\n Now is the sun upon the highmost hill \\n Of this day\\'s journey, and from nine till twelve \\n Is three long hours; yet she is not come. \\n Had she affections and warm youthful blood, \\n She would be as swift in motion as a ball; \\n My words would bandy her to my sweet love, \\n And his to me, \\n But old folks, many feign as they were dead- \\n Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. \\n Enter Nurse [and Peter]. \\n O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news? \\n Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. \\n Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate. \\n [Exit Peter.] \\n Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look\\'st thou sad?  Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; \\n If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news \\n By playing it to me with so sour a face. \\n Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile. \\n Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had! \\n Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. \\n Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak. \\n Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile? \\n Do you not see that I am out of breath? \\n Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath  To say to me that thou art out of breath? \\n The excuse that thou dost make in this delay \\n Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. \\n Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that. \\n Say either, and I\\'ll stay the circumstance. \\n Let me be satisfied, is\\'t good or bad? \\n Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to  choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better  than any man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s; and for a hand and a  foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk\\'d on, yet  they are past compare.

I\\' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.  Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? \\n Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,  and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where  is your mother? \\n Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. \\n Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! \\n \\'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, \\n \"Where is your mother?\"\\' \\n Nurse.

These violent delights have violent ends \\n And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, \\n Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey  Is loathsome in his own deliciousness \\n And in the taste confounds the appetite. \\n Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; \\n Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. \\n Enter Juliet. \\n Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot \\n Will ne\\'er wear out the everlasting flint. \\n A lover may bestride the gossamer \\n That idles in the wanton summer air, \\n And yet not fall; so light is vanity. \\n Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor. \\n Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much. \\n Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy \\n Be heap\\'d like mine, and that thy skill be more \\n To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath \\n This neighbour air, and let rich music\\'s tongue \\n Unfold the imagin\\'d happiness that both \\n Receive in either by this dear encounter. \\n Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, \\n Brags of his substance, not of ornament. \\n They are but beggars that can count their worth;  But my true love is grown to such excess \\n cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. \\n Friar.

Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters  the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and  says \\'God send me no need of thee!\\' and by the operation of the  second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. \\n Ben.

And what to? \\n Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,  for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a  man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.  Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no  other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an  eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels  as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as  addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell\\'d with a  man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog  that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a  tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with  another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt  tutor me from quarrelling! \\n Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should  buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. \\n Mer. The fee simple? O simple! \\n Enter Tybalt and others. \\n Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets. \\n Mer. By my heel, I care not. \\n Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them. \\n Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you. \\n Mer. And but one word with one of us? \\n Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow. \\n Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me  occasion. \\n Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving \\n Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. \\n Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make  minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here\\'s my  fiddlestick; here\\'s that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort! \\n Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men. \\n Either withdraw unto some private place \\n And reason coldly of your grievances, \\n Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us. \\n Mer. Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.  I will not budge for no man\\'s pleasure, \\n Enter Romeo. \\n Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. \\n Mer.

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? \\n Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo\\'s hand did stay.  Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink \\n How nice the quarrel was, and urg\\'d withal \\n Your high displeasure. All this- uttered \\n With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow\\'d-  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen \\n Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts \\n With piercing steel at bold Mercutio\\'s breast;  Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats  Cold death aside and with the other sends \\n It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity \\n Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, \\n \\'Hold, friends! friends, part!\\' and swifter than his tongue,  His agile arm beats down their fatal points,  And \\'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm  An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life \\n Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; \\n But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, \\n Who had but newly entertain\\'d revenge, \\n And to\\'t they go like lightning; for, ere I \\n Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;  And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. \\n This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. \\n Cap.

Come, civil night,  Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, \\n And learn me how to lose a winning match, \\n Play\\'d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. \\n Hood my unmann\\'d blood, bating in my cheeks,  With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,  Think true love acted simple modesty. \\n Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;  For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night \\n Whiter than new snow upon a raven\\'s back. \\n Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow\\'d night;  Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, \\n Take him and cut him out in little stars, \\n And he will make the face of heaven so fine \\n That all the world will be in love with night  And pay no worship to the garish sun. \\n O, I have bought the mansion of a love, \\n But not possess\\'d it; and though I am sold, \\n Not yet enjoy\\'d. So tedious is this day \\n As is the night before some festival \\n To an impatient child that hath new robes \\n And may not wear them.

What is the Prince\\'s doom  What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand  That I yet know not? \\n Friar. Too familiar \\n Is my dear son with such sour company. \\n I bring thee tidings of the Prince\\'s doom.  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince\\'s doom? \\n Friar. A gentler judgment vanish\\'d from his lips-  Not body\\'s death, but body\\'s banishment. \\n Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say \\'death\\';  For exile hath more terror in his look,  Much more than death. Do not say \\'banishment.\\' \\n Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.  Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. \\n Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,  But purgatory, torture, hell itself. \\n Hence banished is banish\\'d from the world,  And world\\'s exile is death. Then \\'banishment\\'  Is death misterm\\'d. Calling death \\'banishment,\\'  Thou cut\\'st my head off with a golden axe  And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. \\n Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!  Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,  Taking thy part, hath rush\\'d aside the law,  And turn\\'d that black word death to banishment.  This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. \\n Rom. \\'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,  Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog  And little mouse, every unworthy thing,  Live here in heaven and may look on her;  But Romeo may not. More validity, \\n More honourable state, more courtship lives  In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize  On the white wonder of dear Juliet\\'s hand  And steal immortal blessing from her lips,  Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, \\n Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;  But Romeo may not- he is banished. \\n This may flies do, when I from this must fly;  They are free men, but I am banished. \\n And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?

How hast thou the heart,  Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, \\n A sin-absolver, and my friend profess\\'d, \\n To mangle me with that word \\'banished\\'? \\n Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. \\n Friar. I\\'ll give thee armour to keep off that word;  Adversity\\'s sweet milk, philosophy, \\n To comfort thee, though thou art banished. \\n Rom. Yet \\'banished\\'? Hang up philosophy! \\n Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, \\n Displant a town, reverse a prince\\'s doom, \\n It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. \\n Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.

Doth not she think me an old murtherer, \\n Now I have stain\\'d the childhood of our joy \\n With blood remov\\'d but little from her own? \\n Where is she? and how doth she! and what says  My conceal\\'d lady to our cancell\\'d love? \\n Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;  And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,  And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, \\n And then down falls again. \\n Rom. As if that name, \\n Shot from the deadly level of a gun, \\n Did murther her; as that name\\'s cursed hand \\n Murder\\'d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,  In what vile part of this anatomy \\n Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack  The hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.] \\n Friar. Hold thy desperate hand. \\n Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;  Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote  The unreasonable fury of a beast. \\n Unseemly woman in a seeming man! \\n Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! \\n Thou hast amaz\\'d me. By my holy order, \\n I thought thy disposition better temper\\'d. \\n Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?  And slay thy lady that in thy life lives, \\n By doing damned hate upon thyself? \\n Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?  Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet  In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.  Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,  Which, like a usurer, abound\\'st in all, \\n And usest none in that true use indeed \\n Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax \\n Digressing from the valour of a man; \\n Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, \\n Killing that love which thou hast vow\\'d to cherish;  Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, \\n Misshapen in the conduct of them both, \\n Like powder in a skilless soldier\\'s flask, \\n is get afire by thine own ignorance, \\n And thou dismemb\\'red with thine own defence.

Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;  But much of grief shows still some want of wit. \\n Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. \\n Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend  Which you weep for. \\n Jul. Feeling so the loss, \\n I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. \\n Lady. Well, girl, thou weep\\'st not so much for his death  As that the villain lives which slaughter\\'d him. \\n Jul. What villain, madam? \\n Lady. That same villain Romeo. \\n Jul.

Come you to make confession to this father?  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you. \\n Par. Do not deny to him that you love me. \\n Jul. I will confess to you that I love him. \\n Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. \\n Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price, \\n Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus\\'d with tears. \\n Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,  For it was bad enough before their spite. \\n Par. Thou wrong\\'st it more than tears with that report. \\n Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;  And what I spake, I spake it to my face. \\n Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland\\'red it. \\n Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own. \\n Are you at leisure, holy father, now, \\n Or shall I come to you at evening mass \\n Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.  My lord, we must entreat the time alone. \\n Par. God shield I should disturb devotion! \\n Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye. \\n Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit.  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 52/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help! \\n Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;  It strains me past the compass of my wits.  I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,  On Thursday next be married to this County. \\n Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear\\'st of this,  Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.  If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,  Do thou but call my resolution wise \\n And with this knife I\\'ll help it presently.  God join\\'d my heart and Romeo\\'s, thou our hands;  And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo\\'s seal\\'d,  Shall be the label to another deed, \\n Or my true heart with treacherous revolt  Turn to another, this shall slay them both.  Therefore, out of thy long-experienc\\'d time,  Give me some present counsel; or, behold,  \\'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife  Shall play the empire, arbitrating that  Which the commission of thy years and art  Could to no issue of true honour bring.  Be not so long to speak. I long to die \\n If what thou speak\\'st speak not of remedy. \\n Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,  Which craves as desperate an execution \\n As that is desperate which we would prevent.  If, rather than to marry County Paris \\n Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,  Then is it likely thou wilt undertake \\n A thing like death to chide away this shame,  That cop\\'st with death himself to scape from it;  And, if thou dar\\'st, I\\'ll give thee remedy. \\n Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,  From off the battlements of yonder tower,  Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk  Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,  Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, \\n O\\'ercover\\'d quite with dead men\\'s rattling bones,  With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;  Or bid me go into a new-made grave \\n And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-  Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-  And I will do it without fear or doubt,  To live an unstain\\'d wife to my sweet love. \\n Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent  To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.  To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;  Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.  Take thou this vial, being then in bed,  And this distilled liquor drink thou off;  When presently through all thy veins shall run  A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse \\n Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;  No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;  The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade  To paly ashes, thy eyes\\' windows fall \\n Like death when he shuts up the day of life;  Each part, depriv\\'d of supple government,  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;  And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 53/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, \\n And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. \\n Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes  To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.  Then, as the manner of our country is, \\n In thy best robes uncovered on the bier \\n Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault  Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. \\n In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, \\n Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; \\n And hither shall he come; and he and I \\n Will watch thy waking, and that very night \\n Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. \\n And this shall free thee from this present shame,  If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear \\n Abate thy valour in the acting it. \\n Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! \\n Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous  In this resolve. I\\'ll send a friar with speed  To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. \\n Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.

Pardon, I beseech you! \\n Henceforward I am ever rul\\'d by you. \\n Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.  I\\'ll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. \\n Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence\\' cell  And gave him what becomed love I might, \\n Not stepping o\\'er the bounds of modesty. \\n Cap. Why, I am glad on\\'t. This is well. Stand up.  This is as\\'t should be. Let me see the County.  Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. \\n Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, \\n All our whole city is much bound to him. \\n Jul.

The obsequies that I for thee will keep \\n Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.  Whistle Boy.  The boy gives warning something doth approach.  What cursed foot wanders this way to-night \\n To cross my obsequies and true love\\'s rite? \\n What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile. [Retires.] \\n Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,  and a crow of iron. \\n Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.  Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning  See thou deliver it to my lord and father. \\n Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,  Whate\\'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof  And do not interrupt me in my course. \\n Why I descend into this bed of death \\n Is partly to behold my lady\\'s face, \\n But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger  A precious ring- a ring that I must use \\n In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.  But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry \\n In what I farther shall intend to do, \\n By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint \\n And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.  The time and my intents are savage-wild, \\n More fierce and more inexorable far \\n Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. \\n Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. \\n Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.  Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow. \\n Bal. [aside] For all this same, I\\'ll hide me hereabout.  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [Retires.] \\n Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, \\n Gorg\\'d with the dearest morsel of the earth,  Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, \\n And in despite I\\'ll cram thee with more food.  Romeo opens the tomb. \\n Par. This is that banish\\'d haughty Montague \\n That murd\\'red my love\\'s cousin- with which grief  It is supposed the fair creature died- \\n And here is come to do some villanous shame \\n To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. \\n Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague! \\n Can vengeance be pursu\\'d further than death?  Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. \\n Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. \\n Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.  Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp\\'rate man.  Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,  But not another sin upon my head \\n By urging me to fury. O, be gone! \\n By heaven, I love thee better than myself, \\n For I come hither arm\\'d against myself.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 64/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Stay not, be gone.

They fight. \\n Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.  [Exit. Paris falls.] \\n Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful, \\n Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [Dies.] \\n Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.  Mercutio\\'s kinsman, noble County Paris! \\n What said my man when my betossed soul \\n Did not attend him as we rode? I think \\n He told me Paris should have married Juliet.  Said he not so? or did I dream it so? \\n Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet \\n To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, \\n One writ with me in sour misfortune\\'s book! \\n I\\'ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. \\n A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught\\'red youth,  For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes \\n This vault a feasting presence full of light.  Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr\\'d.  [Lays him in the tomb.]  How oft when men are at the point of death \\n Have they been merry! which their keepers call  A lightning before death. O, how may I \\n Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! \\n Death, that hath suck\\'d the honey of thy breath,  Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. \\n Thou art not conquer\\'d. Beauty\\'s ensign yet \\n Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, \\n And death\\'s pale flag is not advanced there.  Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?  O, what more favour can I do to thee \\n Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain  To sunder his that was thine enemy? \\n Forgive me, cousin.\\' Ah, dear Juliet, \\n Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe \\n That unsubstantial Death is amorous, \\n And that the lean abhorred monster keeps \\n Thee here in dark to be his paramour? \\n For fear of that I still will stay with thee  And never from this palace of dim night \\n Depart again. Here, here will I remain \\n With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here  Will I set up my everlasting rest \\n And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars \\n From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!  Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you  The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss  A dateless bargain to engrossing death! \\n Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!  Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on \\n The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! \\n Here\\'s to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!  Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night  Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who\\'s there? \\n Bal. Here\\'s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. \\n Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,  What torch is yond that vainly lends his light  To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, \\n It burneth in the Capels\\' monument. \\n Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there\\'s my master,  One that you love. \\n Friar. Who is it? \\n Bal. Romeo. \\n Friar. How long hath he been there? \\n Bal. Full half an hour. \\n Friar. Go with me to the vault. \\n Bal. I dare not, sir. \\n My master knows not but I am gone hence, \\n And fearfully did menace me with death \\n If I did stay to look on his intents. \\n Friar. Stay then; I\\'ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.  O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing. \\n Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, \\n I dreamt my master and another fought, \\n And that my master slew him. \\n Friar. Romeo! \\n Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains  The stony entrance of this sepulchre? \\n What mean these masterless and gory swords \\n To lie discolour\\'d by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]  Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? \\n And steep\\'d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour  Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.  Juliet rises. \\n Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord? \\n I do remember well where I should be, \\n And there I am. Where is my Romeo? \\n Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest  Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. \\n A greater power than we can contradict \\n Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. \\n Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; \\n And Paris too. Come, I\\'ll dispose of thee \\n Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. \\n Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.  Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. \\n Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. \\n Exit [Friar].  What\\'s here? A cup, clos\\'d in my true love\\'s hand?  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 66/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop \\n To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. \\n Haply some poison yet doth hang on them \\n To make me die with a restorative. [Kisses him.]  Thy lips are warm! \\n Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way? \\n Yea, noise? Then I\\'ll be brief. O happy dagger!  [Snatches Romeo\\'s dagger.]  This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo\\'s body]. \\n Enter [Paris\\'s] Boy and Watch. \\n Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. \\n Chief Watch. \\'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.  Go, some of you; whoe\\'er you find attach. \\n [Exeunt some of the Watch.]  Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain; \\n And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, \\n Who here hath lain this two days buried. \\n Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets; \\n Raise up the Montagues; some others search. \\n [Exeunt others of the Watch.]  We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, \\n But the true ground of all these piteous woes \\n We cannot without circumstance descry. \\n Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo\\'s Man [Balthasar].  2. Watch. Here\\'s Romeo\\'s man. We found him in the churchyard.  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.  Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman. \\n 3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.  We took this mattock and this spade from him \\n As he was coming from this churchyard side. \\n Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.  Enter the Prince [and Attendants]. \\n Prince. What misadventure is so early up, \\n That calls our person from our morning rest? \\n Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others]. \\n Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? \\n Wife. The people in the street cry \\'Romeo,\\' \\n Some \\'Juliet,\\' and some \\'Paris\\'; and all run, \\n With open outcry, toward our monument. \\n Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears? \\n Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;  And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, \\n Warm and new kill\\'d.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 67/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. \\n Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter\\'d Romeo\\'s man,  With instruments upon them fit to open \\n These dead men\\'s tombs. \\n Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!  This dagger hath mista\\'en, for, lo, his house  Is empty on the back of Montague, \\n And it missheathed in my daughter\\'s bosom! \\n Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell  That warns my old age to a sepulchre. \\n Enter Montague [and others]. \\n Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up  To see thy son and heir more early down. \\n Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!  Grief of my son\\'s exile hath stopp\\'d her breath.  What further woe conspires against mine age? \\n Prince. Look, and thou shalt see. \\n Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,  To press before thy father to a grave? \\n Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,  Till we can clear these ambiguities \\n And know their spring, their head, their true descent;  And then will I be general of your woes \\n And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,  And let mischance be slave to patience. \\n Bring forth the parties of suspicion. \\n Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,  Yet most suspected, as the time and place  Doth make against me, of this direful murther;  And here I stand, both to impeach and purge  Myself condemned and myself excus\\'d. \\n Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this. \\n Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath  Is not so long as is a tedious tale. \\n Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;  And she, there dead, that Romeo\\'s faithful wife.  I married them; and their stol\\'n marriage day  Was Tybalt\\'s doomsday, whose untimely death  Banish\\'d the new-made bridegroom from this city;  For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\\'d.  You, to remove that siege of grief from her,  Betroth\\'d and would have married her perforce  To County Paris. Then comes she to me \\n And with wild looks bid me devise some mean  To rid her from this second marriage, \\n Or in my cell there would she kill herself.  Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) \\n A sleeping potion; which so took effect \\n As I intended, for it wrought on her \\n The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo  That he should hither come as this dire night  To help to take her from her borrowed grave,\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 68/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Being the time the potion\\'s force should cease.  But he which bore my letter, Friar John,  Was stay\\'d by accident, and yesternight  Return\\'d my letter back. Then all alone  At the prefixed hour of her waking \\n Came I to take her from her kindred\\'s vault;  Meaning to keep her closely at my cell  Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.  But when I came, some minute ere the time  Of her awaking, here untimely lay \\n The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. \\n She wakes; and I entreated her come forth  And bear this work of heaven with patience;  But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,  And she, too desperate, would not go with me,  But, as it seems, did violence on herself.  All this I know, and to the marriage \\n Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this  Miscarried by my fault, let my old life  Be sacrific\\'d, some hour before his time,  Unto the rigour of severest law. \\n Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.  Where\\'s Romeo\\'s man? What can he say in this? \\n Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet\\'s death;  And then in post he came from Mantua \\n To this same place, to this same monument.  This letter he early bid me give his father,  And threat\\'ned me with death, going in the vault,  If I departed not and left him there. \\n Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.  Where is the County\\'s page that rais\\'d the watch?  Sirrah, what made your master in this place? \\n Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady\\'s grave;  And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. \\n Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;  And by-and-by my master drew on him; \\n And then I ran away to call the watch. \\n Prince. This letter doth make good the friar\\'s words,  Their course of love, the tidings of her death;  And here he writes that he did buy a poison  Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal \\n Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.  Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,  See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,  That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!  And I, for winking at you, discords too,  Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish\\'d. \\n Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.  This is my daughter\\'s jointure, for no more  Can I demand. \\n Mon. But I can give thee more; \\n For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,  That whiles Verona by that name is known,  There shall no figure at such rate be set  As that of true and faithful Juliet. \\n Cap. As rich shall Romeo\\'s by his lady\\'s lie-  Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 69/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings. \\n The sun for sorrow will not show his head. \\n Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; \\n Some shall be pardon\\'d, and some punished; \\n For never was a story of more woe \\n Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. \\n Exeunt omnes.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause. \\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm \\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. \\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org. \\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation \\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 74/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. \\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org \\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. \\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. \\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate \\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. \\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. \\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. \\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:  http://www.gutenberg.org \\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 75/75'"

The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,  And the continuance of their parents' rage, \\n Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,  Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; \\n The which if you with patient ears attend, \\n What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.  [Exit.] \\nACT I. Scene I. \\nVerona. A public place. \\nEnter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet. \\n Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers. \\n Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. \\n Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved. \\n Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. \\n Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.  Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. \\n Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take  the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 3/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the  wall. \\n Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,  are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men  from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. \\n Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. \\n Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have  fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off  their heads. \\n Greg. The heads of the maids? \\n Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.  Take it in what sense thou wilt. \\n Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it. \\n Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I  am a pretty piece of flesh. \\n Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst  been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of  Montagues. \\n Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. \\n Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.  Greg. How? turn thy back and run? \\n Samp. Fear me not. \\n Greg. No, marry. I fear thee! \\n Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. \\n Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is  disgrace to them, if they bear it. \\n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. \\n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. \\n Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my  thumb, sir. \\n Greg. Do you quarrel, sir? \\n Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. \\n Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as  you.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 4/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Abr. No better. \\n Samp. Well, sir. \\n Enter Benvolio. \\n Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my  master's kinsmen. \\n Samp. Yes, better, sir. \\n Abr. You lie. \\n Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.  They fight. \\n Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.] \\n Put up your swords. You know not what you do.  Enter Tybalt. \\n Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?  Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. \\n Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,  Or manage it to part these men with me. \\n Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. \\n Have at thee, coward! They fight. \\n Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or  partisans. \\n Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!  Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. \\n Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? \\n Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come \\n And flourishes his blade in spite of me. \\n Enter Old Montague and his Wife. \\n Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.  Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. \\n Prince.

On pain of torture, from those bloody hands \\n Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground  And hear the sentence of your moved prince. \\n Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word \\n By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, \\n Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets  And made Verona's ancient citizens \\n Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments \\n To wield old partisans, in hands as old, \\n Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.  If ever you disturb our streets again, \\n Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.  For this time all the rest depart away. \\n You, Capulet, shall go along with me; \\n And, Montague, come you this afternoon, \\n To know our farther pleasure in this case, \\n To old Freetown, our common judgment place. \\n Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.  Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. \\n Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? \\n Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary \\n And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.  I drew to part them. In the instant came \\n The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd; \\n Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, \\n He swung about his head and cut the winds, \\n Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,  Came more and more, and fought on part and part,  Till the Prince came, who parted either part. \\n M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?  Right glad I am he was not at this fray. \\n Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun \\n Peer'd forth the golden window of the East, \\n A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; \\n Where, underneath the grove of sycamore \\n That westward rooteth from the city's side, \\n So early walking did I see your son. \\n Towards him I made; but he was ware of me \\n And stole into the covert of the wood. \\n I- measuring his affections by my own, \\n Which then most sought where most might not be found,  Being one too many by my weary self- \\n Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his, \\n And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. \\n Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen, \\n With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun \\n Should in the furthest East bean to draw \\n The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, \\n Away from light steals home my heavy son \\n And private in his chamber pens himself, \\n Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight \\n And makes himself an artificial night. \\n Black and portentous must this humour prove \\n Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 6/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? \\n Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him \\n Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means? \\n Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; \\n But he, his own affections' counsellor, \\n Is to himself- I will not say how true- \\n But to himself so secret and so close, \\n So far from sounding and discovery, \\n As is the bud bit with an envious worm \\n Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. \\n Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,  We would as willingly give cure as know. \\n Enter Romeo. \\n Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. \\n Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay \\n To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,  Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. \\n Ben. Good morrow, cousin. \\n Rom. Is the day so young? \\n Ben. But new struck nine. \\n Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long. \\n Was that my father that went hence so fast? \\n Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.  Ben. In love? \\n Rom. Out- \\n Ben. Of love? \\n Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. \\n Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, \\n Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! \\n Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!  Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. \\n Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.  Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! \\n O anything, of nothing first create! \\n O heavy lightness! serious vanity! \\n Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! \\n Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is \\n This love feel I, that feel no love in this.  Dost thou not laugh?\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 7/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. No, coz, I rather weep. \\n Rom. Good heart, at what? \\n Ben. At thy good heart's oppression. \\n Rom. Why, such is love's transgression. \\n Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest  With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.  Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;  Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;  Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.  What is it else? A madness most discreet,  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. \\n Farewell, my coz. \\n Ben. Soft! I will go along. \\n An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. \\n Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:  This is not Romeo, he's some other where. \\n Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee? \\n Ben. Groan? Why, no; \\n But sadly tell me who. \\n Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.  Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. \\n Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. \\n Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit  With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit, \\n And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,  From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,  Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. \\n O, she's rich in beauty; only poor \\n That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? \\n Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;  For beauty, starv'd with her severity, \\n Cuts beauty off from all posterity. \\n She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,  To merit bliss by making me despair. \\n She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow  Do I live dead that live to tell it now. \\n Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 8/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes. \\n Examine other beauties. \\n Rom. 'Tis the way \\n To call hers (exquisite) in question more. \\n These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,  Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.  He that is strucken blind cannot forget \\n The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. \\n Show me a mistress that is passing fair, \\n What doth her beauty serve but as a note \\n Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?  Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. \\n Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt. \\nScene II. \\nA Street. \\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. \\n Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I, \\n In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,  For men so old as we to keep the peace. \\n Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both, \\n And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long. \\n But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? \\n Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before: \\n My child is yet a stranger in the world, \\n She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;  Let two more summers wither in their pride \\n Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. \\n Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made. \\n Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.  The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;  She is the hopeful lady of my earth. \\n But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart; \\n My will to her consent is but a part. \\n An she agree, within her scope of choice \\n Lies my consent and fair according voice. \\n This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, \\n Whereto I have invited many a guest, \\n Such as I love; and you among the store, \\n One more, most welcome, makes my number more.  At my poor house look to behold this night \\n Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel \\n When well apparell'd April on the heel \\n Of limping Winter treads, even such delight \\n Among fresh female buds shall you this night  Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, \\n And like her most whose merit most shall be;  Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,  May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.  Come, go with me.

Find them out whose names are written here? It is written  that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor  with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter  with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are  here writ, and can never find what names the writing person  hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! \\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo. \\n Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;  One pain is lessoned by another's anguish; \\n Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; \\n One desperate grief cures with another's languish.  Take thou some new infection to thy eye, \\n And the rank poison of the old will die. \\n Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. \\n Ben. For what, I pray thee? \\n Rom. For your broken shin. \\n Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? \\n Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; \\n Shut up in Prison, kept without my food, \\n Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow. \\n Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? \\n Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. \\n Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can  you read anything you see? \\n Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. \\n Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry! \\n Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads. \\n 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; \\n County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; \\n The lady widow of Vitruvio; \\n Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces; \\n Mercutio and his brother Valentine; \\n Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; \\n My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; \\n Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt; \\n Lucio and the lively Helena.' \\n [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they  come? \\n Serv. Up. \\n Rom. Whither? \\n Serv. To supper, to our house.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 10/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Rom. Whose house? \\n Serv. My master's. \\n Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before. \\n Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great  rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray  come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit. \\n Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's \\n Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st; \\n With all the admired beauties of Verona. \\n Go thither, and with unattainted eye \\n Compare her face with some that I shall show, \\n And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. \\n Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye \\n Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;  And these, who, often drown'd, could never die, \\n Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! \\n One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun \\n Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. \\n Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, \\n Herself pois'd with herself in either eye; \\n But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd \\n Your lady's love against some other maid \\n That I will show you shining at this feast, \\n And she shall scant show well that now seems best. \\n Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, \\n But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.] \\nScene III. \\nCapulet's house. \\nEnter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse. \\n Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me. \\n Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, \\n I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! \\n God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! \\n Enter Juliet. \\n Jul. How now? Who calls? \\n Nurse. Your mother. \\n Jul. Madam, I am here. \\n What is your will? \\n Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,  We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; \\n I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel. \\n Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 11/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.  Wife. She's not fourteen. \\n Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth- \\n And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-  She is not fourteen. How long is it now \\n To Lammastide? \\n Wife. A fortnight and odd days. \\n Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, \\n Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.  Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)  Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; \\n She was too good for me. But, as I said, \\n On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;  That shall she, marry; I remember it well. \\n 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;  And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),  Of all the days of the year, upon that day;  For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, \\n Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.  My lord and you were then at Mantua. \\n Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, \\n When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple  Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, \\n To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!  Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,  To bid me trudge. \\n And since that time it is eleven years, \\n For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,  She could have run and waddled all about; \\n For even the day before, she broke her brow;  And then my husband (God be with his soul! \\n 'A was a merry man) took up the child. \\n 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?  Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;  Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam, \\n The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'  To see now how a jest shall come about! \\n I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,  I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,  And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.' \\n Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. \\n Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh  To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'  And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow \\n A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone; \\n A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly. \\n 'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?  Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;  Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.' \\n Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. \\n Nurse. Peace, I have done.

Younger than you,  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, \\n Are made already mothers. By my count, \\n I was your mother much upon these years \\n That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: \\n The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. \\n Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man \\n As all the world- why he's a man of wax. \\n Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower. \\n Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower. \\n Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?  This night you shall behold him at our feast.  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, \\n And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;  Examine every married lineament, \\n And see how one another lends content; \\n And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies \\n Find written in the margent of his eyes, \\n This precious book of love, this unbound lover,  To beautify him only lacks a cover. \\n The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride  For fair without the fair within to hide. \\n That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,  That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;  So shall you share all that he doth possess, \\n By having him making yourself no less. \\n Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men \\n Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? \\n Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;  But no more deep will I endart mine eye \\n Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.  Enter Servingman. \\n Serv.

Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.  Being but heavy, I will bear the light. \\n Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. \\n Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes  With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead \\n So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. \\n Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings \\n And soar with them above a common bound. \\n Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft \\n To soar with his light feathers; and so bound  I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. \\n Under love's heavy burthen do I sink. \\n Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-  Too great oppression for a tender thing. \\n Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, \\n Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn. \\n Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.  Give me a case to put my visage in. \\n A visor for a visor! What care I \\n What curious eye doth quote deformities? \\n Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. \\n Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in \\n But every man betake him to his legs. \\n Rom. A torch for me!

And we mean well, in going to this masque;  But 'tis no wit to go. \\n Mer. Why, may one ask? \\n Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night. \\n Mer. And so did I. \\n Rom. Well, what was yours? \\n Mer. That dreamers often lie. \\n Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. \\n Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.  She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes  In shape no bigger than an agate stone \\n On the forefinger of an alderman, \\n Drawn with a team of little atomies \\n Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; \\n Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,  The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;  Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;  Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;  Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;  Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, \\n Not half so big as a round little worm \\n Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; \\n Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, \\n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,  Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.  And in this state she 'gallops night by night  Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;  O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;  O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;  O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,  Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.  Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail  Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,  Then dreams he of another benefice. \\n Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,  Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,  And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab \\n That plats the manes of horses in the night  And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,  Which once untangled much misfortune bodes  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,  That presses them and learns them first to bear,  Making them women of good carriage. \\n This is she- \\n Rom.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,  Which mannerly devotion shows in this; \\n For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. \\n Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r. \\n Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!  They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. \\n Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. \\n Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.  Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. [Kisses her.] \\n Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. \\n Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!  Give me my sin again.

Come, he hath hid himself among these trees  To be consorted with the humorous night. \\n Blind is his love and best befits the dark. \\n Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.  Now will he sit under a medlar tree \\n And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit  As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.

It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! \\n Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, \\n Who is already sick and pale with grief \\n That thou her maid art far more fair than she.  Be not her maid, since she is envious. \\n Her vestal livery is but sick and green, \\n And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. \\n It is my lady; O, it is my love! \\n O that she knew she were! \\n She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?  Her eye discourses; I will answer it. \\n I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks. \\n Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, \\n Having some business, do entreat her eyes \\n To twinkle in their spheres till they return.  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven \\n Would through the airy region stream so bright  That birds would sing and think it were not night.  See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! \\n O that I were a glove upon that hand, \\n That I might touch that cheek! \\n Jul. Ay me! \\n Rom. She speaks. \\n O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art \\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,  As is a winged messenger of heaven \\n Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes \\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him \\n When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds \\n And sails upon the bosom of the air. \\n Jul.

My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words  Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.  Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? \\n Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. \\n Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,  And the place death, considering who thou art,  If any of my kinsmen find thee here. \\n Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;  For stony limits cannot hold love out, \\n And what love can do, that dares love attempt.  Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. \\n Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee. \\n Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye  Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,  And I am proof against their enmity. \\n Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here. \\n Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;  And but thou love me, let them find me here.  My life were better ended by their hate \\n Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place? \\n Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.  He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. \\n I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far \\n As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,  I would adventure for such merchandise. \\n Jul.

But thou art not quickly moved to strike.  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. \\n Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.  Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. \\n Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take  the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 3/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the  wall. \\n Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,  are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men  from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. \\n Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. \\n Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have  fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off  their heads. \\n Greg. The heads of the maids? \\n Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.  Take it in what sense thou wilt. \\n Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it. \\n Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I  am a pretty piece of flesh. \\n Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst  been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of  Montagues. \\n Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. \\n Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.  Greg. How? turn thy back and run? \\n Samp. Fear me not. \\n Greg. No, marry. I fear thee! \\n Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. \\n Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is  disgrace to them, if they bear it. \\n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. \\n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. \\n Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my  thumb, sir. \\n Greg. Do you quarrel, sir? \\n Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. \\n Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as  you.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 4/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Abr. No better. \\n Samp. Well, sir. \\n Enter Benvolio. \\n Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my  master's kinsmen. \\n Samp. Yes, better, sir. \\n Abr. You lie. \\n Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.  They fight. \\n Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.] \\n Put up your swords. You know not what you do.  Enter Tybalt. \\n Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?  Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. \\n Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,  Or manage it to part these men with me. \\n Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. \\n Have at thee, coward! They fight. \\n Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or  partisans. \\n Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!  Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. \\n Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? \\n Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come \\n And flourishes his blade in spite of me. \\n Enter Old Montague and his Wife. \\n Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.  Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. \\n Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, \\n Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel- \\n Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 5/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n That quench the fire of your pernicious rage  With purple fountains issuing from your veins!  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands \\n Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground  And hear the sentence of your moved prince. \\n Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word \\n By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, \\n Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets  And made Verona's ancient citizens \\n Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments \\n To wield old partisans, in hands as old, \\n Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.  If ever you disturb our streets again, \\n Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.  For this time all the rest depart away. \\n You, Capulet, shall go along with me; \\n And, Montague, come you this afternoon, \\n To know our farther pleasure in this case, \\n To old Freetown, our common judgment place. \\n Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.  Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. \\n Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? \\n Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary \\n And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.  I drew to part them. In the instant came \\n The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd; \\n Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, \\n He swung about his head and cut the winds, \\n Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,  Came more and more, and fought on part and part,  Till the Prince came, who parted either part. \\n M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?  Right glad I am he was not at this fray. \\n Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun \\n Peer'd forth the golden window of the East, \\n A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; \\n Where, underneath the grove of sycamore \\n That westward rooteth from the city's side, \\n So early walking did I see your son. \\n Towards him I made; but he was ware of me \\n And stole into the covert of the wood. \\n I- measuring his affections by my own, \\n Which then most sought where most might not be found,  Being one too many by my weary self- \\n Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his, \\n And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. \\n Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen, \\n With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun \\n Should in the furthest East bean to draw \\n The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, \\n Away from light steals home my heavy son \\n And private in his chamber pens himself, \\n Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight \\n And makes himself an artificial night. \\n Black and portentous must this humour prove \\n Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 6/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? \\n Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him \\n Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means? \\n Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; \\n But he, his own affections' counsellor, \\n Is to himself- I will not say how true- \\n But to himself so secret and so close, \\n So far from sounding and discovery, \\n As is the bud bit with an envious worm \\n Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. \\n Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,  We would as willingly give cure as know. \\n Enter Romeo. \\n Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. \\n Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay \\n To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,  Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. \\n Ben. Good morrow, cousin. \\n Rom. Is the day so young? \\n Ben. But new struck nine. \\n Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long. \\n Was that my father that went hence so fast? \\n Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.  Ben. In love? \\n Rom. Out- \\n Ben. Of love? \\n Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. \\n Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, \\n Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! \\n Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!  Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. \\n Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.  Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! \\n O anything, of nothing first create! \\n O heavy lightness! serious vanity! \\n Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! \\n Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is \\n This love feel I, that feel no love in this.  Dost thou not laugh?\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 7/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. No, coz, I rather weep. \\n Rom. Good heart, at what? \\n Ben. At thy good heart's oppression. \\n Rom. Why, such is love's transgression. \\n Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest  With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.  Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;  Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;  Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.  What is it else? A madness most discreet,  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. \\n Farewell, my coz. \\n Ben. Soft! I will go along. \\n An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. \\n Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:  This is not Romeo, he's some other where. \\n Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee? \\n Ben. Groan? Why, no; \\n But sadly tell me who. \\n Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.  Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. \\n Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. \\n Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit  With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit, \\n And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,  From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,  Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. \\n O, she's rich in beauty; only poor \\n That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? \\n Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;  For beauty, starv'd with her severity, \\n Cuts beauty off from all posterity. \\n She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,  To merit bliss by making me despair. \\n She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow  Do I live dead that live to tell it now. \\n Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 8/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes. \\n Examine other beauties. \\n Rom. 'Tis the way \\n To call hers (exquisite) in question more. \\n These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,  Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.  He that is strucken blind cannot forget \\n The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. \\n Show me a mistress that is passing fair, \\n What doth her beauty serve but as a note \\n Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?  Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. \\n Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt. \\nScene II. \\nA Street. \\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. \\n Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I, \\n In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,  For men so old as we to keep the peace. \\n Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both, \\n And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long. \\n But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? \\n Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before: \\n My child is yet a stranger in the world, \\n She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;  Let two more summers wither in their pride \\n Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. \\n Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made. \\n Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.  The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;  She is the hopeful lady of my earth. \\n But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart; \\n My will to her consent is but a part. \\n An she agree, within her scope of choice \\n Lies my consent and fair according voice. \\n This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, \\n Whereto I have invited many a guest, \\n Such as I love; and you among the store, \\n One more, most welcome, makes my number more.  At my poor house look to behold this night \\n Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel \\n When well apparell'd April on the heel \\n Of limping Winter treads, even such delight \\n Among fresh female buds shall you this night  Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, \\n And like her most whose merit most shall be;  Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,  May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.  Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,  sirrah, trudge about\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 9/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Through fair Verona; find those persons out \\n Whose names are written there, and to them say, \\n My house and welcome on their pleasure stay- \\n Exeunt [Capulet and Paris]. \\n Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written  that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor  with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter  with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are  here writ, and can never find what names the writing person  hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! \\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo. \\n Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;  One pain is lessoned by another's anguish; \\n Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; \\n One desperate grief cures with another's languish.  Take thou some new infection to thy eye, \\n And the rank poison of the old will die. \\n Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. \\n Ben. For what, I pray thee? \\n Rom. For your broken shin. \\n Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? \\n Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; \\n Shut up in Prison, kept without my food, \\n Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow. \\n Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? \\n Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. \\n Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can  you read anything you see? \\n Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. \\n Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry! \\n Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads. \\n 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; \\n County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; \\n The lady widow of Vitruvio; \\n Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces; \\n Mercutio and his brother Valentine; \\n Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; \\n My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; \\n Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt; \\n Lucio and the lively Helena.' \\n [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they  come? \\n Serv. Up. \\n Rom. Whither? \\n Serv. To supper, to our house.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 10/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Rom. Whose house? \\n Serv. My master's. \\n Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before. \\n Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great  rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray  come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit. \\n Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's \\n Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st; \\n With all the admired beauties of Verona. \\n Go thither, and with unattainted eye \\n Compare her face with some that I shall show, \\n And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. \\n Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye \\n Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;  And these, who, often drown'd, could never die, \\n Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! \\n One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun \\n Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. \\n Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, \\n Herself pois'd with herself in either eye; \\n But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd \\n Your lady's love against some other maid \\n That I will show you shining at this feast, \\n And she shall scant show well that now seems best. \\n Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, \\n But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.] \\nScene III. \\nCapulet's house. \\nEnter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse. \\n Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me. \\n Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, \\n I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! \\n God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! \\n Enter Juliet. \\n Jul. How now? Who calls? \\n Nurse. Your mother. \\n Jul. Madam, I am here. \\n What is your will? \\n Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,  We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; \\n I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel. \\n Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 11/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.  Wife. She's not fourteen. \\n Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth- \\n And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-  She is not fourteen. How long is it now \\n To Lammastide? \\n Wife. A fortnight and odd days. \\n Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, \\n Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.  Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)  Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; \\n She was too good for me. But, as I said, \\n On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;  That shall she, marry; I remember it well. \\n 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;  And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),  Of all the days of the year, upon that day;  For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, \\n Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.  My lord and you were then at Mantua. \\n Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, \\n When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple  Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, \\n To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!  Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,  To bid me trudge. \\n And since that time it is eleven years, \\n For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,  She could have run and waddled all about; \\n For even the day before, she broke her brow;  And then my husband (God be with his soul! \\n 'A was a merry man) took up the child. \\n 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?  Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;  Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam, \\n The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'  To see now how a jest shall come about! \\n I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,  I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,  And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.' \\n Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. \\n Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh  To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'  And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow \\n A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone; \\n A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly. \\n 'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?  Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;  Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.' \\n Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. \\n Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!  Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.  An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. \\n Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme \\n I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,  How stands your disposition to be married?\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 12/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of. \\n Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse, \\n I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. \\n Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, \\n Are made already mothers. By my count, \\n I was your mother much upon these years \\n That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: \\n The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. \\n Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man \\n As all the world- why he's a man of wax. \\n Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower. \\n Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower. \\n Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?  This night you shall behold him at our feast.  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, \\n And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;  Examine every married lineament, \\n And see how one another lends content; \\n And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies \\n Find written in the margent of his eyes, \\n This precious book of love, this unbound lover,  To beautify him only lacks a cover. \\n The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride  For fair without the fair within to hide. \\n That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,  That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;  So shall you share all that he doth possess, \\n By having him making yourself no less. \\n Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men \\n Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? \\n Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;  But no more deep will I endart mine eye \\n Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.  Enter Servingman. \\n Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,  my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and  everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you  follow straight. \\n Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman].  Juliet, the County stays. \\n Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.  Exeunt. \\nScene IV. \\nA street.\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 13/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torchbearers. \\n Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?  Or shall we on without apology? \\n Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. \\n We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,  Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, \\n Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper; \\n Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke \\n After the prompter, for our entrance; \\n But, let them measure us by what they will, \\n We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. \\n Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.  Being but heavy, I will bear the light. \\n Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. \\n Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes  With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead \\n So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. \\n Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings \\n And soar with them above a common bound. \\n Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft \\n To soar with his light feathers; and so bound  I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. \\n Under love's heavy burthen do I sink. \\n Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-  Too great oppression for a tender thing. \\n Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, \\n Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn. \\n Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.  Give me a case to put my visage in. \\n A visor for a visor! What care I \\n What curious eye doth quote deformities? \\n Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. \\n Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in \\n But every man betake him to his legs. \\n Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart  Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;  For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase, \\n I'll be a candle-holder and look on; \\n The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. \\n Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!  If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire  Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st  Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! \\n Rom. Nay, that's not so. \\n Mer. I mean, sir, in delay \\n We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.  Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 14/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n Five times in that ere once in our five wits. \\n Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;  But 'tis no wit to go. \\n Mer. Why, may one ask? \\n Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night. \\n Mer. And so did I. \\n Rom. Well, what was yours? \\n Mer. That dreamers often lie. \\n Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. \\n Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.  She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes  In shape no bigger than an agate stone \\n On the forefinger of an alderman, \\n Drawn with a team of little atomies \\n Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; \\n Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,  The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;  Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;  Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;  Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;  Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, \\n Not half so big as a round little worm \\n Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; \\n Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, \\n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,  Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.  And in this state she 'gallops night by night  Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;  O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;  O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;  O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,  Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.  Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail  Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,  Then dreams he of another benefice. \\n Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,  Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,  And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab \\n That plats the manes of horses in the night  And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,  Which once untangled much misfortune bodes  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,  That presses them and learns them first to bear,  Making them women of good carriage. \\n This is she- \\n Rom.

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r. \\n Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!  They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. \\n Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. \\n Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.

An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. \\n Mer. This cannot anger him.

Come, he hath hid himself among these trees  To be consorted with the humorous night. \\n Blind is his love and best befits the dark. \\n Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.  Now will he sit under a medlar tree \\n And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit  As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.

Enter Juliet above at a window. \\n But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?  It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! \\n Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, \\n Who is already sick and pale with grief \\n That thou her maid art far more fair than she.  Be not her maid, since she is envious. \\n Her vestal livery is but sick and green, \\n And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. \\n It is my lady; O, it is my love! \\n O that she knew she were! \\n She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?  Her eye discourses; I will answer it. \\n I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks. \\n Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, \\n Having some business, do entreat her eyes \\n To twinkle in their spheres till they return.  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven \\n Would through the airy region stream so bright  That birds would sing and think it were not night.  See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! \\n O that I were a glove upon that hand, \\n That I might touch that cheek! \\n Jul. Ay me! \\n Rom. She speaks. \\n O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art \\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,  As is a winged messenger of heaven \\n Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes \\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him \\n When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds \\n And sails upon the bosom of the air. \\n Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?  Deny thy father and refuse thy name! \\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, \\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet. \\n Rom.

I take thee at thy word. \\n Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;  Henceforth I never will be Romeo. \\n Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,  So stumblest on my counsel? \\n Rom. By a name \\n I know not how to tell thee who I am. \\n My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,  Because it is an enemy to thee. \\n Had I it written, I would tear the word. \\n Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words  Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.  Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? \\n Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. \\n Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,  And the place death, considering who thou art,  If any of my kinsmen find thee here. \\n Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;  For stony limits cannot hold love out, \\n And what love can do, that dares love attempt.  Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. \\n Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee. \\n Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye  Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,  And I am proof against their enmity. \\n Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here. \\n Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;  And but thou love me, let them find me here.  My life were better ended by their hate \\n Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place? \\n Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.  He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. \\n I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far \\n As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,  I would adventure for such merchandise. \\n Jul.

Yet, if thou swear'st,  Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,  They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, \\n If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. \\n Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, \\n I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,  So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, \\n And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;  But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true  Than those that have more cunning to be strange.  I should have been more strange, I must confess,  But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, \\n My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me, \\n And not impute this yielding to light love, \\n Which the dark night hath so discovered. \\n Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, \\n That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops- \\n Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,  That monthly changes in her circled orb, \\n Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. \\n Rom. What shall I swear by? \\n Jul. Do not swear at all; \\n Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,  Which is the god of my idolatry, \\n And I'll believe thee. \\n Rom. If my heart's dear love- \\n Jul. Well, do not swear.

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. \\n Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage! \\n Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath \\n Forbid this bandying in Verona streets. \\n Hold, Tybalt!

[Exit Page.] \\n Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much. \\n Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;  but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you  shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this  world. A plague o' both your houses!

O my brother's child!  O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd  Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,  For blood of ours shed blood of Montague. \\n O cousin, cousin! \\n Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? \\n Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.  Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink \\n How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal \\n Your high displeasure. All this- uttered \\n With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen \\n Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts \\n With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;  Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats  Cold death aside and with the other sends \\n It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity \\n Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, \\n 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,  His agile arm beats down their fatal points,  And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm  An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life \\n Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; \\n But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, \\n Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, \\n And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I \\n Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;  And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. \\n This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. \\n Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague; \\n Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.  Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,  And all those twenty could but kill one life.  I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.  Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live. \\n Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. \\n Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? \\n Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;  His fault concludes but what the law should end,  The life of Tybalt. \\n Prince. And for that offence \\n Immediately we do exile him hence. \\n I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,  My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt 38/75 \\n2/24/22, 1:58 PM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1112/1112.txt \\n But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine \\n That you shall all repent the loss of mine. \\n I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; \\n Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.

So tedious is this day \\n As is the night before some festival \\n To an impatient child that hath new robes \\n And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,  Enter Nurse, with cords. \\n And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks  But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. \\n Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords  That Romeo bid thee fetch? \\n Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords. \\n [Throws them down.]  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands \\n Nurse.

Jul. Can heaven be so envious? \\n Nurse. Romeo can, \\n Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo! \\n Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! \\n Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?  This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.  Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'  And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.  I am not I, if there be such an 'I'; \\n Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'  If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'  Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. \\n Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,  (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.  A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;  Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,  All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight. \\n Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!  To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,  And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! \\n Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!  O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman \\n That ever I should live to see thee dead! \\n Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?  Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?  My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?  Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!  For who is living, if those two are gone? \\n Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;  Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. \\n Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did! \\n Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? \\n Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! \\n Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!  Despised substance of divinest show! \\n Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-  A damned saint, an honourable villain!  O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell  When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend  In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?  Was ever book containing such vile matter  So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell  In such a gorgeous palace! \\n Nurse. There's no trust, \\n No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,  All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.  Ah, where's my man?

He was not born to shame. \\n Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; \\n For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd  Sole monarch of the universal earth. \\n O, what a beast was I to chide at him! \\n Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? \\n Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?  Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name  When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?  But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?  That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.  Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!  Your tributary drops belong to woe, \\n Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. \\n My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;  And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.  All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? \\n Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,  That murd'red me. I would forget it fain; \\n But O, it presses to my memory \\n Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds! \\n 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.' \\n That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' \\n Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death  Was woe enough, if it had ended there; \\n Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship \\n And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,  Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'  Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, \\n Which modern lamentation might have mov'd? \\n But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,  'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word \\n Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, \\n All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'- \\n There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, \\n In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.  Where is my father and my mother, nurse? \\n Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.  Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. \\n Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,  When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.  Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,  Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd. \\n He made you for a highway to my bed; \\n But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. \\n Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;  And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! \\n Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo \\n To comfort you. I wot well where he is. \\n Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night. \\n I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell. \\n Jul.

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.  Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts, \\n And thou art wedded to calamity. \\n Enter Romeo. \\n Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom  What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand  That I yet know not? \\n Friar. Too familiar \\n Is my dear son with such sour company. \\n I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom? \\n Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-  Not body's death, but body's banishment. \\n Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';  For exile hath more terror in his look,  Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.' \\n Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.  Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. \\n Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,  But purgatory, torture, hell itself. \\n Hence banished is banish'd from the world,  And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'  Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'  Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe  And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. \\n Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!  Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,  Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,  And turn'd that black word death to banishment.  This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. \\n Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,  Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog  And little mouse, every unworthy thing,  Live here in heaven and may look on her;  But Romeo may not. More validity, \\n More honourable state, more courtship lives  In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize  On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand  And steal immortal blessing from her lips,  Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, \\n Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;  But Romeo may not- he is banished. \\n This may flies do, when I from this must fly;  They are free men, but I am banished. \\n And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?

How hast thou the heart,  Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, \\n A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, \\n To mangle me with that word 'banished'? \\n Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. \\n Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;  Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, \\n To comfort thee, though thou art banished. \\n Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy! \\n Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, \\n Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, \\n It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. \\n Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.  Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, \\n An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, \\n Doting like me, and like me banished, \\n Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,  And fall upon the ground, as I do now, \\n Taking the measure of an unmade grave. \\n Knock [within].  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself. \\n Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,  Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock. \\n Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;  Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; Knock.  Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will, \\n What simpleness is this.- I come, I come! Knock.  Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will \\n Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.  I come from Lady Juliet. \\n Friar. Welcome then. \\n Enter Nurse. \\n Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar \\n Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? \\n Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. \\n Nurse.

Even so lies she, \\n Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.  Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man. \\n For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!  Why should you fall into so deep an O? \\n Rom. (rises) Nurse- \\n Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all. \\n Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?  Doth not she think me an old murtherer, \\n Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy \\n With blood remov'd but little from her own? \\n Where is she? and how doth she! and what says  My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? \\n Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;  And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,  And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, \\n And then down falls again. \\n Rom. As if that name, \\n Shot from the deadly level of a gun, \\n Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand \\n Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,  In what vile part of this anatomy \\n Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack  The hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.] \\n Friar.

    "#### The information in this graph displays the network of the play among the characters. Each node has a bridge which distinguishes their relationships amongst each other. For example, Romeo has the most bridges and edges among the characters. Evidently, the edges of Romeo showcase  metrics of connectedness and centralization. We can also observe the the degree of nearness (direct or indirect) between the node and the rest of the nodes. Benvolio for example, is a node that is distant from the rest with the least amount of edges. The density of the network according to the code is .92. The most important nodes are the ones with the highest closeness centrality and degree centrality. These factors help identify significant actors in a social network. Degree centrality is a node with a great number of links and connections in a network. Both Romeo and Balthasar have strong networks in the graph. Between centrality also plays a role in the importance of nodes. Nodes with high betweeness centrality help information flow, especially in cohesive networks like this one. "
